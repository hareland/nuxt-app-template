# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (and humans) working in this workspace app.

## Notes

- Nuxt 4.5
- `@nuxt/ui` 4.10
- Uses `@nuxthub/db` and `@nuxthub/kv`

## Workspace layout

```
./nuxt.config.ts              Nuxt configuration — source of truth for modules, runtime config, and aliases
./shared/**                   Code shared between ./app and ./server (must work in both environments)
./app/**                      App-specific code (browser/client + Nuxt app context only)
./server/**                   Server-specific code (Nitro/server context only)
./server/db/schema.sqlite.ts  SQLite Drizzle database schema
./server/db/migrations/**     SQLite Drizzle database migrations
./server/tasks/**             Server-side tasks (cron jobs, etc.)
./**/utils/**                 Utility functions
./shared/schema/**            Zod schemas for shared types and auto-generated forms
./modules/**                  Nuxt modules
```

Don't put code that depends on a specific environment (browser APIs, Nitro
server context, etc.) in `./shared/**` — it needs to run in both `./app` and
`./server` unmodified.

## Useful commands

```bash
pnpm dev             # start the dev server
pnpm lint            # run ESLint
pnpm lint:fix        # run ESLint with auto-fix
pnpm db:migrate      # run Drizzle database migrations
pnpm db:generate     # generate Drizzle migration files from schema changes
pnpm db:clear        # clear the database (requires migrations to be re-applied)
pnpm db:seed         # seed the database with test data (dev server must be running)
pnpm db:seed:users   # seed the database with user data (dev server must be running)
pnpm prepare:env     # prepare environment variables for the dev server
pnpm prepare:certs   # prepare the public/private key pair used for encryption in the dev server
```
